### Feature

Welcome to our coding academy! We're thrilled to have you join us on your journey to becoming a web developer. As you begin your studies, you'll be learning the fundamentals of HTML, the building blocks of the web.

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. It's made up of a series of elements, each with a specific purpose, that are arranged in a specific order to create the structure and content of a web page.

Here are some basic concepts you'll learn in your HTML course:

- Elements: The basic building blocks of HTML, elements are represented by tags, which come in pairs. The opening tag tells the browser where to start an element, and the closing tag tells the browser where to end it.
- Tags: The tags that surround HTML elements are made up of a start tag and an end tag. For example, the opening tag for a paragraph is "<p>" and the closing tag is "</p>".
- Attributes: These are additional pieces of information that can be added to tags to give them more meaning. For example, the "href" attribute specifies the URL of a link.
- Semantic HTML: This is the practice of using HTML elements to describe the meaning of the content on a web page, rather than just its presentation. For example, using the "<header>" element to define the header of a web page, rather than just using a heading.

By the end of your course, you'll have a solid understanding of HTML and be able to create your own web pages using the language. You'll also be well on your way to becoming a proficient web developer, with the skills and knowledge you need to create dynamic, interactive web applications.

Week 1: Introduction to Web Development

- Overview of web development and the technologies involved
- Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Setting up a development environment
  - Overview of Programming Concepts and Paradigms:

Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in programming languages, which are designed to communicate with the computer's processor. There are several programming paradigms, or styles, that are commonly used to develop software. These include:

1. Imperative Programming: This paradigm focuses on the steps needed to complete a task. It uses a sequence of commands to tell the computer what to do, and the computer executes these commands one at a time. Examples of imperative programming languages include C, C++, and Java.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): This paradigm organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes that define the properties and behaviors of a specific entity. OOP allows for code reuse and modularity, making it easier to maintain and scale software. Examples of OOP languages include C++, Java, and Python.
3. Functional Programming: This paradigm emphasizes the use of functions to perform tasks, rather than imperative commands. Functional programming encourages modular, composable code, and is often used in parallel and distributed computing. Examples of functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, and Scala.
4. Declarative Programming: This paradigm focuses on describing what the program should do, rather than how it should do it. Declarative programming is often used in database query languages, such as SQL, and in domain-specific languages (DSLs) for specific tasks, such as XML or HTML.

Basic Programming Principles and Syntax:

Regardless of the programming paradigm used, there are several basic principles and syntax elements that are common to all programming languages. These include:

1. Variables: A variable is a named storage location that holds a value. Variables can be assigned values using the assignment operator (=), and can be used to store and manipulate data.
2. Data Types: Each variable has a data type, which determines the type of data it can hold. Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings.
3. Control Flow: Control flow refers to the order in which the program executes instructions. Common control flow statements include if/else statements, loops (such as for, while, and do/while), and switch statements.
4. Functions: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take arguments, which are values passed to the function when it is called, and can return values.
5. Arrays and Lists: An array is
